here is a list of strings that already have id's assigned to them these need to be added to the compiler's string-intern so id's don't get mixed.

stringsMap["has"]			= 0;
stringsMap["get"]			= 1;
stringsMap[":"]				= 2;
stringsMap["set"]			= 3;
stringsMap["remove"]		= 4;
stringsMap["clone"]			= 5;
stringsMap["to-s"]			= 6;
stringsMap["to-string"]		= 7;
stringsMap["to-i"]			= 8;
